# Course Project

This repository has been created to complete the course project for Coursera: "Getting and Cleaning Data".
It contains the script ([run_analysis.R](.//run_analysis.R)) and a code book ([CodeBook.md](.//CodeBook.md)).
The script download and extract the data and returns a dataset "tidydata" with the average mean and standard deviation mesurements, by activity and by subject.

The assignment has been completed using R 3.2.2 on Ubuntu 15.04 32bits.
